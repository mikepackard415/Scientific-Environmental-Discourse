### January 4th, 2022
This is the first time since the end of the autumn quarter that I have turned my attention back toward this thesis project. It was a bit of a rough push to get a "data memo" together for Sanja. I am growing accustomed to these projects being comprised of a series of rough pushes.

Regardless, I am back at it. I am dedicating an hour tonight, of which we are already halfway through. Given that the quarter was pushed back by a week, I don't have much else going on these days, so I am setting a goal that I will dedicate two hours each day until my classes start, at which point I will likely cut back. Today and some of tomorrow will be spent mostly on organizational tasks, creating to-do lists, and setting goals.

Right now I am working on getting Atom up and running. I think I will prefer it to VSCode; I'm assuming that since it is made by GitHub it will integrate pretty seamlessly. VSCode is made by Microsoft. Admittedly, this probably isn't the highest priority item to be working on, but I'd like to have an easy-to-use text editor at my disposal for making updates to programs and to this README file. Right now I am just editing on GitHub.com.

1 hour in, still struggling to get Atom to be openable from the Ubuntu command line. Will try again tomorrow, but I'll commit to not spending more than 30 minutes on this issue.

Well, I spent the half hour trying to get Atom to open with a command in the Ubuntu terminal. Would have been nice, but no dice. Moving on to folder organization, which I think will take me to 12:45 or so. Then I'll put in the second hour later in the day.

It is now 9:40 pm - I'm starting my second hour of thesis work. Going to open up a jupyter notebook, read in the Resilience data, and start playing around with topic modeling.

Considering whether to expand my archive to be more inclusive of other environmental blogs. It certainly feels a little too heuristic to have more than 70% of my data coming from the place I worked over the summer. Grist is the website I remember Rob and Asher mentioning as being somewhat similar to Resilience, so I think tonight I'll start working on scraping Grist. I hope I'm not just doing this to delay the more uncertain work.

### January 6th, 2022
New day. I am 30 minutes in and I have the Grist data collector running. By a very rough estimate, I think it'll take about 2 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to look around for any other sites that might be worth scraping. I also need to work on the IRB process more soon. It'll be good to get that out of the way.

About to sign off, ending my first hour of the day. I have an article list for InsideClimateNews, and the Grist scraper is doing its thing, currently at 8%. Going to do a few errands around the apartment before coming back to get another hour in. I'm liking this system so far, hope I can keep it up for a while.

Just put in another 15 minutes to get the ICN scraping rolling. 45 minutes left for today.

Starting now on my 45 minute session. The Grist scraper is still running, believe it or not. But the ICN scraper finished up, which is nice. I think I'm going to interrupt the Grist scraper, save out what's been collected so far, and use that in building a big Environmental Discourse dataframe in a new notebook, which I can play with while the scraper finishes up. It would be nice to get some exploratory plots and stuff going.

That's that. Good day of work. Time to settle in for a relaxing evening. Until tomorrow!

### January 10th, 2022
Okay, I fell off the wagon the last few days with regards to thesis work. On Friday I had a headache because I didn't eat enough Thursday night. On Saturday we spent the entire day in the suburbs. I could have worked in the basement for an hour, but didn't feel like it. On Sunday... I can't remember why but I didn't do anything. Today is Monday, and it's already 11:47 pm, so not too much of Monday left. Regardless, I'm going to sneak in a half hour of thesis work before bed. Will call it quits around 12:20. 

What would be good to accomplish tonight? How about a dynamic word embedding model that tracks the word "science" in the environmental discourse corpus. That sounds like a good idea.

Believe it or not I actually got the code running in 30 minutes (just copied it from MACS 30124). The stemming step is taking its time, as will the fitting step I imagine. So I'll let it run overnight and we'll see in the morning if it produces anything cool. Just kind of having fun with this stuff right now.

### January 13th
Here we go ahead. It is 10:53 pm and I am sneaking in an hour long session. Goals are to clean up he w2v models I generated last time, and then put my shoulder into the approval process. Just want to get that out of the way. And it is important, anyway.

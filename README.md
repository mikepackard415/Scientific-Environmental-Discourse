Scientific Environmental Discourse

### January 4th, 2022
This is the first time since the end of the autumn quarter that I have turned my attention back toward this thesis project. It was a bit of a rough push to get a "data memo" together for Sanja. I am growing accustomed to these projects being comprised of a series of rough pushes. 

Regardless, I am back at it. I am dedicating an hour tonight, of which we are already halfway through. Given that the quarter was pushed back by a week, I don't have much else going on these days, so I am setting a goal that I will dedicate two hours each day until my classes start, at which point I will likely cut back. Today and some of tomorrow will be spent mostly on organizational tasks, creating to-do lists, and setting goals.

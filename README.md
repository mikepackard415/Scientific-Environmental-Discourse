### January 4th, 2022
This is the first time since the end of the autumn quarter that I have turned my attention back toward this thesis project. It was a bit of a rough push to get a "data memo" together for Sanja. I am growing accustomed to these projects being comprised of a series of rough pushes.

Regardless, I am back at it. I am dedicating an hour tonight, of which we are already halfway through. Given that the quarter was pushed back by a week, I don't have much else going on these days, so I am setting a goal that I will dedicate two hours each day until my classes start, at which point I will likely cut back. Today and some of tomorrow will be spent mostly on organizational tasks, creating to-do lists, and setting goals.

Right now I am working on getting Atom up and running. I think I will prefer it to VSCode; I'm assuming that since it is made by GitHub it will integrate pretty seamlessly. VSCode is made by Microsoft. Admittedly, this probably isn't the highest priority item to be working on, but I'd like to have an easy-to-use text editor at my disposal for making updates to programs and to this README file. Right now I am just editing on GitHub.com.

1 hour in, still struggling to get Atom to be openable from the Ubuntu command line. Will try again tomorrow, but I'll commit to not spending more than 30 minutes on this issue.

Well, I spent the half hour trying to get Atom to open with a command in the Ubuntu terminal. Would have been nice, but no dice. Moving on to folder organization, which I think will take me to 12:45 or so. Then I'll put in the second hour later in the day.
